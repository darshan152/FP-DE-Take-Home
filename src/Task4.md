### Question 4

In your own words (short paragraphs conveying your thoughts), answer the following questions:
* What is refactoring? When and why should you refactor?
* What is testing? When and why should you write test cases?


#### Refactoring
Refactoring of code is the process of improving the internal workings of the code, such as its structure, but without making changes to how the code behaves. Some examples of refactoring are breaking up functions in order to allow for more re-usability, re-writing conditional statements in order to make it easier to read and code styling changes in order to make it consistent throughout the project. Refactoring aims to make the code more readable, maintainable and extensible.
Refactoring should be done continually, as the project grows in size. However, it could be hard to continuously refactor older parts of the code. Thus, some indicators of when code should be refactored are when the code becomes hard to read or understand, or when fixing bugs found in the codebase is becoming increasingly hard.

#### Testing
Testing is the process of checking if a software or piece of code is working as intended. Test cases should be written for every non-trivial piece of code, especially if there will be people who are using the application. This helps to ensure that the behavior of the application meets the requirements of the users. Test cases should be written whenever a new feature is created, which helps to detect bugs earlier, which reduces the cost of fixing the bugs.
